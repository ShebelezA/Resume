    Uploaded Resume Text (Primary Source):

    The user has uploaded their existing resume as text. Use this text as the PRIMARY source of information. Parse it to extract contact details, summary, work experience, education, and skills.

    Job Description for Tailoring:

    **Very Important Content Generation Guidelines:**
    1.  **Data Merging (If Uploaded Resume Exists):**
        *   Extract all relevant information (contact, summary, experience, education, skills) from the 'Uploaded Resume Text'.
        *   Cross-reference with 'User Data' (form input). If a field is present in 'User Data', it takes precedence or augments the uploaded text.
    2.  **Completeness and Proactive Enhancement (If no Upload or Sparse Data):** If 'Uploaded Resume Text' is not provided OR if both sources combined still result in sparse or key sections (summary, experience, education, skills) being missing, empty, or underdeveloped, you MUST generate plausible, professional, and relevant content.
        *   **Smart Suggestions based on Role/Industry:** Crucially, use 'userData.personal.targetRole' and 'userData.personal.targetIndustry' (if provided) to proactively suggest and incorporate:
            *   Common and impactful skills (technical and soft).
            *   Industry-standard keywords and terminology.
            *   Strong action verbs for experience bullet points.
            *   Relevant points for the summary.
        *   This applies even if the user provided some basic info; enhance it. For example, if targetRole is 'Software Engineer' and skills are few, add typical software engineering skills.
        *   Base this generation primarily on: 'AI Customization Instructions', 'targetRole', 'targetIndustry', and the 'jobDescription'.
        *   If 'AI Customization Instructions' request resume generation for a role (e.g., "generate a resume for a junior web developer") and data for experience/education is sparse, create 1-2 relevant fictional entries.
    3.  **Prioritize User Input:** Always prioritize and incorporate any information the user *has* provided. Use AI generation to fill gaps, expand, enhance, parse, and structureâ€”not to wholesale replace user input unless it's placeholder or instructions explicitly ask for generation.
    4.  **Format Adherence:** The final output must be a SINGLE VALID JSON object. No extra explanations, apologies, or markdown formatting around the JSON block.

    Return the resume as a SINGLE VALID JSON object with the following exact structure. Do not add any extra explanations or markdown before or after the JSON object itself:
    \`\`\`json
    {
      "contact": {
        "name": "string (From merged sources, or generate a placeholder if absolutely necessary and all data is empty)",
        "email": "string (From merged sources, or generate placeholder)",
        "phone": "string (From merged sources, or generate placeholder)",
        "linkedin": "string (optional, from merged sources or generated if implied by role/instructions)",
        "portfolio": "string (optional, from merged sources or generated if implied by role/instructions)",
        "address": "string (optional, e.g., City, State, from merged sources or generated)"
      },
      "summary": "string (A compelling professional summary, 3-5 sentences. Based on merged data, tailored by job description, AI customization, targetRole/Industry. Generate/Enhance a strong, relevant summary if missing or brief.)",
      "experience": [
        {
          "jobTitle": "string",
          "company": "string",
          "location": "string (e.g., City, State)",
          "startDate": "string (e.g., MM/YYYY)",
          "endDate": "string (e.g., MM/YYYY or 'Present')",
          "responsibilities": ["string (bullet point starting with an action verb, quantify achievements. Parse from 'achievements' in UserData or uploaded text. Generate/Enhance 2-3 plausible entries with 3-5 responsibilities each if section is empty/sparse, guided by targetRole/Industry.)"]
        }
      ],
      "education": [
        {
          "degree": "string",
          "institution": "string",
          "location": "string (e.g., City, State, optional)",
          "graduationDate": "string (e.g., MM/YYYY or 'Expected MM/YYYY')",
          "details": ["string (e.g., GPA if high, honors, relevant coursework. Parse from 'notes' in UserData or uploaded text. Generate/Enhance based on role/instructions.)"]
        }
      ],
      "skills": ["string (list of 5-15 relevant skills. Combine user's 'skills' string, uploaded text skills. Proactively add skills based on targetRole/Industry and job description if provided. Aim for a mix of technical and soft skills.)"]
    }
    \`\`\`

    Key Instructions (Reiteration and Elaboration):
    1.  **ATS-Friendly:** Standard sections, clear language.
    2.  **Action Verbs & Quantifiable Achievements:** Critical for experience.
    3.  **Skills Section:** Parse, extract, and *proactively augment* based on role/industry.
    4.  **Summary:** Powerful and tailored, use role/industry for guidance if summary is weak/missing.
    5.  **Data Transformation:** Convert user's 'UserData.skills' string into an array. Integrate with skills from uploaded resume. If all skill sources are empty, generate a relevant list based on role/industry.
    6.  **Strict JSON Output:** Only the JSON object.
